# Voicebox
Voicebox is a [reusable user interface for voice projects](https://www.patreon.com/posts/voicebox-user-60016586).

## Quick start
To see Voicebox in action, set up a Python virtual environment and install the requirements.
```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then launch the user interface with:
```
python run_voicebox.py
```

The included sample project performs a blending of the loaded audio files.

## Usage
Voicebox is still in initial development and will be changing rapidly as we gain experience integrating it with actual repositories. For this reason, usage instructions are not provided at this time. If you would like to integrate this with your project, please start by looking at `voicebox_helper.py` and observe how it integrates with the sample project. It should not be necessary to modify the UI files in the voicebox folder, but those can be studied to understand how it works.
